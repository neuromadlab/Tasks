FCR Version 3 
Update: July 2021

FCR_all is renamed to FCR_main. Many "special cases" were removed for clarity, incl. Bedvar No-Food Runs. 
Instead, future studies will need to create these special cases via adaptations in their unique randomization skripts.  

The Output structure was simplified, as to have one main field "output.data" with another field indicating the output labels. 
The output structure is documented in detail in the FCR_V3_readme. 

The Wanting and Liking scales were simplified (Joystick and Mouse Option, the mouse option is not tested yet!).
Further the LHS and VAS scripts within the FCR folder are now specifically for the FCR, the option as a standalone experiment was
removed (as this did not work anyways). 

Future studies that use the FCR in the scanner and reintroduce block design, need to extend the current output variable:
%block index (relevant for MR block design)
%block type (relevant for MR block design)
%block id (relevant for MR block design)   

Following variables were renamed: 
* block_repetition => repetition 
Indicate the count of all FCR-runs for one participant across all sessions, as there are at least 2 runs
(liking and wanting) per session. Not to mixed up with the Run that is entered initially, that is "attempts" (e.g. if a trial fails/ needs to restart, in order not to owerwrite data) 
Was named repetition elsewhere in script/ eased up 

* sweet => "food_category_sweet"
* high_caloric => "caloric_category_high"

The Reaction Time is recorded now. 

The Jitter file needs to be created elsewhere and the path specified in the beginning of the script. 

Open to discuss/Problems/to-be-checked: 
timing.min_ISI = 0.3; 
# How is this determined/set? Does it fit to the current Jitter file that says something about 0.7? 

# The Jitter file is not correct, needs trials*2*2 (for each fixation cross). 
How is is Jitter created? I would like to incorporate it directly in the script. 

#Are the timestamps correclty calculated? Specifically Jitter Fix 1 und Fix2 use different calculations. 

WaitSecs(timing.min_ISI+jitter(count_jitter));
timestamps.jitter_fix1(i_trial) = jitter(count_jitter);
versus 
jitter_duration = timing.min_ISI + jitter(count_jitter);
WaitSecs(jitter_duration);
timestamps.jitter_fix2(i_trial) = jitter_duration;
